abstract: Network embedding which assigns nodes in networks to low-dimensional
  representations has received increasing attention in recent years. However,
  most existing approaches, especially the spectral-based methods, only consider
  the attributes in homogeneous networks. They are weak for heterogeneous
  attributed networks that involve different node types, as well as rich node
  attributes and, are common in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose
  HANE, a novel network embedding method based on Graph Convolutional Networks,
  that leverages both the heterogeneity and the node attributes to generate
  high-quality embeddings. The experiments on the real-world dataset show the
  effectiveness of our method.
