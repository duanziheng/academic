abstract: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a polygenic disorder occurring after extreme trauma exposure. Recent studies have begun to detail the molecular biology of PTSD. However, given the array of PTSD-perturbed molecular pathways identifed so far, it is implausible that a single cell type is responsible. Here we profle the molecular responses in over two million nuclei from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of 111 human brains, collected post-mortem from individuals with and without PTSD and major depressive disorder. We identify neuronal and non-neuronal cell-type clusters, gene expression changes and transcriptional regulators, and map the epigenomic regulome of PTSD in a cell-type-specifc manner. Our analysis revealed PTSD-associated gene alterations in inhibitory neurons, endothelial cells and microglia and uncovered genes and pathways associated with glucocorticoid signalling, GABAergic transmission and neuroinfammation. We further validated these fndings using cell-type-specifc spatial transcriptomics, confrming disruption of key genes such as SST and FKBP5. By integrating genetic, transcriptomic and epigenetic data, we uncovered the regulatory mechanisms of credible variants that disrupt PTSD genes, including ELFN1, MAD1L1 and KCNIP4, in a cell-type-specifc context. Together, these fndings provide a comprehensive characterization of the cell-specifc molecular regulatory mechanisms that underlie the persisting efects of traumatic stress response on the human prefrontal cortex.
