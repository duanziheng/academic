abstract: Granular flow has solid-, liquid-, or even gas-like behaviors, which
  can be described through discrete element method (DEM)-based simulations.
  Although the DEM simulation has advantages in studying particle-scale
  information, it is computationally intensive. Alternatively, this work
  proposes to combine the DEM and deep learning methods to predict granular flow
  behaviors in a wedge-shaped hopper. As the image-based labels are extracted
  from the DEM simulation, an Alexnet-fully connection (FC) model can make
  point-to-point predictions about the discharge time. Furthermore, when the
  first 20% of image-based datasets in the timing sequence are used to train a
  convolutional neural network (CNN)-long short-term memory (LSTM) network, it
  can make process predictions about the number ratio of remaining particles
  (NRRP) in the hopper vs. the discharge time. Although these attempts have some
  shortcomings at the present stage, more efforts are encouraged to stimulate
  the future potential of image-based prediction through the combined methods.
