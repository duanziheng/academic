abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting is an important problem in
  many fields. Accurate forecasting results can effectively help
  decision-making. To date, many MTS forecasting methods have been proposed and
  widely applied. However, these methods assume that the predicted value of a
  single variable is affected by all other variables, which ignores the causal
  relationship among variables. To address the above issue, a novel end-to-end
  deep learning model, termed graph neural network with transfer entropy (TEGNN)
  is proposed in this paper. To characterize the causal information among
  variables, the transfer entropy (TE) graph is introduced in our model, where
  each variable is regarded as a graph node and each edge represents the casual
  relationship between variables. In addition, convolutional neural network
  (CNN) filters with different perception scales are used for time series
  feature extraction, which is used to generate the feature of each node.
  Finally, graph neural network (GNN) is adopted to tackle the forecasting
  problem of graph structure generated by MTS. Three benchmark datasets from the
  real world are used to evaluate the proposed TEGNN and the comprehensive
  experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results in
  MTS forecasting task.
