abstract: Recently, deep neural network models for graph-structured data have
  been demonstrating to be influential in recommendation systems. Graph Neural
  Network (GNN), which can generate high-quality embeddings by capturing
  graph-structured information, is convenient for the recommendation. However,
  most existing GNN models mainly focus on the homogeneous graph. They cannot
  characterize heterogeneous and complex data in the recommendation system.
  Meanwhile, it is challenging to develop effective methods to mine the
  heterogeneity and latent correlations in the graph. In this paper, we adopt
  Heterogeneous Attributed Network (HAN), which involves different node types as
  well as rich node attributes, to model data in the recommendation system.
  Furthermore, we propose a novel graph neural network-based model to deal with
  HAN for Recommendation, called HANRec. In particular, we design a component
  connecting potential neighbors to explore the influence between neighbors and
  provide two different strategies with the attention mechanism to aggregate
  neighbors' information. The experimental results on two real-world datasets
  prove that HANRec outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.
