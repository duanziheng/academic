I am a third-year CS Ph.D. student at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/), advised by Prof. [Jing Zhang](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~jingz31/). 
Previously, I graduated from the [College of Control Science and Technology, Zhejiang University](http://www.cse.zju.edu.cn/english/). 
During my undergrad, I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Xiaoqian Wang](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~joywang/), [Quanzheng Li](https://researchers.mgh.harvard.edu/profile/4211743/Quanzheng-Li), and [Fei Wu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/wufei). 
Now, I am interested in computational biology and machine learning.

Outside my research, I am also a bodybuilder, having competed in [NPC men's physique](https://contests.npcnewsonline.com/contests/2023/npc_southwest_muscle_classic/h3rp/ziheng_duan?page=1) and certified as a personal trainer by [ACE](https://credentials.acefitness.org/19e0e767-1874-4fd1-a8cf-88cdeece0d59).
