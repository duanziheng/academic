I am a second-year CS Ph.D. student at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/), advised by Prof. [Jing Zhang](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~jingz31/). 
Previously, I graduated from the [College of Control Science and Technology, Zhejiang University](http://www.cse.zju.edu.cn/english/). 
During my undergrad, I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Xiaoqian Wang](https://sites.google.com/site/joyxqwang/), [Yueyang Wang](http://www.cse.cqu.edu.cn/info/2097/5067.htm), [Quanzheng Li](https://gordon.mgh.harvard.edu/gc/people/faculty/quanzheng-li/), and [Fei Wu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/wufei). 

Now, I am interested in Machine Learning and Computational Biology.
