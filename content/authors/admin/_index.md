I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/), where I was advised by Prof. [Jing Zhang](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~jingz31/). I received my B.S. degree from the [College of Control Science and Technology, Zhejiang University](http://www.cse.zju.edu.cn/cseenglish/main.htm).
<!-- During my undergrad, I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Xiaoqian Wang](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~joywang/), [Quanzheng Li](https://researchers.mgh.harvard.edu/profile/4211743/Quanzheng-Li), and [Fei Wu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/wufei).  -->

My main research goal is to develop trustworthy computational methods to understand single-cell gene regulation, particularly in spatial contexts, and to translate these insights into applications for disease understanding and drug discovery.

Outside my research, I am also a bodybuilder, having competed in [NPC Men's Physique](https://contests.npcnewsonline.com/contests/2023/npc_southwest_muscle_classic/h3rp/ziheng_duan?page=1), placed 3rd in [WNBF Men's Physique](https://worldnaturalbb.com/competition-results/2025-wnbf-top-guns-natural/), and been certified as a personal trainer by [ACE](https://credentials.acefitness.org/19e0e767-1874-4fd1-a8cf-88cdeece0d59).
