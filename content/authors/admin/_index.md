I am a first-year CS PhD student in University of California, Irvine, advised by Prof. Jing Zhang. 
Previously, I graduated from Department of Control Science and Technology, Zhejiang University. 
During my undergrad, I was fortunate to work with Prof. Xiaoqian Wang, Yueyang Wang, Quanzheng Li and Fei Wu. 

Now, I am interested in Machine Learning and Computational Biology.
